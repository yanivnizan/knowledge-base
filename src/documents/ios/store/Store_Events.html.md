#Event Handling

## About

SOOMLA's iOS-store allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

## How it Works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you about different things that happen involving Store operations.

For example, when a user purchases an item using virtual currency, his/her currency balance changes, causing a `CurrencyBalanceChangedEvent` to be fired.

## Observing & Handling Events

In order to observe store events you need to import `StoreEventHandling.h` and then you can add a notification to `NSNotificationCenter`:

``` objectivec
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(yourCustomSelector:)
  name:EVENT_ITEM_PURCHASED object:nil];
```

OR, you can observe all events with the same selector by calling:

``` objectivec
[EventHandling observeAllEventsWithObserver:self withSelector:@selector(yourCustomSelector:)];
```

Handle the events with your game-specific behavior. These handler functions will be called once the observer gets notified that an event has been triggered.

``` objectivec
- (void)yourCustomSelector:(NSNotification*)notification {
  // handle accordingly
}
```

## Store Events
