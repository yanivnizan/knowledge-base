# Getting Started

## Getting Started

1. Download [ios-profile](http://library.soom.la/fetch/ios-profile/1.0.1?cf=github).

2. The static libs and headers you need are in the zip you downloaded from the link above.

  - Set your project's "Library Search Paths" and "Header Search Paths" to that folder with the `recursive` option.

  - Add `-ObjC -lSoomlaiOSProfile -lSoomlaiOSCore` to the project's "Other Linker Flags".

3. Make sure you have the following frameworks in your application's project: **Security, libsqlite3.0.dylib**.

4. Initialize **Soomla** with a secret of your choise, used to encrypt your user data. (For those who came from older versions, this should be the same as the old "custom secret"):

    ``` objectivec
    [Soomla initializeWithSecret:@"[YOUR CUSTOM GAME SECRET HERE]"];
    ```

5. If integrating a virtual economy with the store module, please see [ios-store](/ios/store/Store_GettingStarted) for store setup.

6. Initalize Soomla Profile:

  ``` objectivec
  [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] initialize];
  ```

  Note that some providers will need initialization parameters (see their sections below), in that case you'll need to supply their parameters here, each with its dictionary:

  ``` objectivec
  NSDictionary* providerParams = @{ @([provider]) : @{...}
                                    ... };
    [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] initialize:providerParams];
  ```

  1. **Facebook** - No parameters

  2. **Google+** - Please provide **CLIENT ID** from the "API&Auth" -> "Credentials" -> "Client ID for iOS applicatio" section in [Google Developer Console Projects](https://console.developers.google.com/project/), like so:

    ```objectivec
    @(GOOGLE) : @{ @"clientId": @"[CLIENT ID]" }
    ```

  3. **Twitter** - Please provide **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** from the "Keys and Access Tokens" section in [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/), like so:

    ```objectivec
    @(TWITTER) : @{ @"consumerKey": @"[YOUR CONSUMER KEY]",
                 @"consumerSecret": @"[YOUR CONSUMER SECRET]" }
    ```

  (OPTIONAL) You can supply the `forceWeb` key in the parameters (with a `BOOL`) value if you would like to force browser-based authorization, like so:

  ```objectivec
  @(TWITTER): @{ ..., @"forceWeb": @(YES) },
  ```

<div class="info-box">The following steps should be done according to the target social network.</div>

**ios-profile** is structured to support multiple social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), at the time of writing this the framework only supports Facebook, Twitter and Google+ integration.

### Facebook

Facebook is supported out-of-the-box, you just have to follow the next steps to make it work:

1. Add the Facebook SDK for iOS to the project's Frameworks and make sure your project links to the project

2. Refer to [Getting Started with the Facebook iOS SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) for more information

3. Add `-lSoomlaiOSProfileFacebook` to the project's "Other Linker Flags".

### Twitter

Twitter is supported out-of-the-box, authentication is done either through the signed in Twitter account (iOS 5+) or through web browser (fallback). Follow the next steps to make it work:

1. Create your Twitter app at https://apps.twitter.com/

2. Add a URL scheme to your application:

  - Go to the application's "Info" section in the build target

  - Under "URL Types" add a new URL type

  - In the "URL Schemes" fill in `tw<Your Twitter app consumer key>` (without the braces)

3. Make sure you have the following frameworks in your application's project: **Twitter, Social, Accounts**.

4. Add `-lSoomlaiOSProfileTwitter -lSTTwitter` to the project's "Other Linker Flags".

  **NOTE** that ios-profile uses the [STTWitter](https://github.com/nst/STTwitter) library (v 0.1.5) to support Twitter integration.

### Google Plus

Google Plus is supported out-of-the-box, authentication is done either through the signed in Google Plus account or through web browser (fallback). Follow the next steps to make it work:

1. Follow [Step 1. Creating the Google Developers Console project](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/getting-started#step_1_creating_the_console_name_project) and create a google+ app for iOS.

  **NOTE:** Set the BUNDLE ID of the google+ app to the bundle identifier of your app.

2. Follow [Step 3. Add a URL type](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/getting-started#step_3_add_a_url_type) and add url type to your application to allow browser based authentication.

3. Navigate to [social-providers/ios-profile-google/libs](https://github.com/soomla/ios-profile/tree/master/social-providers/ios-profile-google/libs) and add the following frameworks to your application:
    * GooglePlus.framework
    * GoogleOpenSource.framework
    * GooglePlus.bundle

  **NOTE** that ios-profile uses [Google Plus SDK 1.7.1](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/ios/upgrading-sdk) to support Google Plus integration.

4. Add additional frameworks to your project:
    * AddressBook.framework
    * AssetsLibrary.framework
    * Foundation.framework
    * CoreLocation.framework
    * CoreMotion.framework
    * CoreGraphics.framework
    * CoreText.framework
    * MediaPlayer.framework
    * Security.framework
    * SystemConfiguration.framework
    * UIKit.framework

5. Add `-lSoomlaiOSProfileGoogle` to the project's "Other Linker Flags".

## Browser-based Authentication

Most social framework SDKs support authentication through your web browser, when the user finishes authenticating through the browser your application will be called dependent on the URL schemes you have defined.

The callback to this process is `openURL` which should be defined in your `AppDelegate`, **ios-profile** provides you with a helper method to handle the `openURL` callback through its providers. Add the following code to your `AppDelegate` to handle this properly:

``` objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
         annotation:(id)annotation
{
    BOOL urlWasHandled = [[SoomlaProfile getInstance] tryHandleOpenURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];

    if (urlWasHandled) {
        return urlWasHandled;
    }

    // Profile was unable to handle callback, do some custom handling
    return NO;
}
```

## Caveats


### Facebook Caveats

1. **Facebook Application** - You must create a Facebook application and use its details in your Profile-based application (with Facebook)

2. **Facebook ID and Display name** - The Facebook application's ID and Name must be used in your application, this information must be added to the application's `plist` file, under `FacebookAppID` (App ID) and `FacebookDisplayName` (Application name)

3. **URL Schemes and openURL** - To support web-based authorization and dialogs the application needs to handle URL schemes (see [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios/v2.1) for more information):

  - Under the project's info add an entry to `URL Types` and under `URL Schemes` add the string `fbxxxxxxx` the x's should be replaced with your Facebook App ID.

  - See [Browser-based Authentication](#browser-based-authentication)

4. **Facebook Permissions** - Profile will request `publish_actions` from the user of the application, to test the application please make sure you test with either Admin, Developer or Tester roles

### Twitter Caveats

1. **Login method returns 401 error** - this could be the result of a few issues:

  - Have you supplied the correct consumer key and secret in `SoomlaProfile` initialization?

  - Have you supplied a `Callback URL` in your Twitter application settings?

### Google Plus Caveats

1. **401. That's an error. Error:invalid_client** - this could be the result of a few issues:

  - Have you supplied the correct client id in `SoomlaProfile` initialization?

  - Does your google+ app BUNDLE ID equal to the Bundle Identifier of your iOS app?

  - Did you add a URL type with identifier and Url Schemes set to your Bundle Identifier?

2. Did you add all required the frameworks?

##Example

Below is a brief example of initializing Profile, logging the user into Facebook, and sharing a story on the user's Facebook wall. To see a full example, check out the [iOS Profile Example](https://github.com/soomla/ios-profile/tree/master/SoomlaiOSProfileExample).
