#**App Store IAB**

##Define your IAP products

1. Create your app in Apple’s IAP for Developers. If you’re not sure how to do this, please read Apple's [In-App Purchase for Developers](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/) before continuing.

2. In iTunesConnect under your app, go to the "Manage In-App Purchases" tab.

    - Click on "Create New".

    - Choose the type of the product you would like, Consumable or Non-Consumable (For `SingleUseVG`s choose Consumable, for `LifetimeVG`s choose NonConsumable). To learn more about Apples’ Consumable/Non-Consumable products please see [Getting Started with In-App Purchase on iOS and OS X](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/In-App-Purchase-Guidelines.pdf).

      <div class="warning-box">Please note that SOOMLA does not support Subscription products, so do not choose these options.</div>

    - Insert a Product ID for your product. In the [Getting Started](/docs/platforms/ios/GettingStarted) tutorial you were to define product IDs for the products you wanted to sell in the App Store. Now, when you define the product IDs in the App Store, they should be EXACTLY the same as you defined them in the code.

    - Fill out the rest of the mandatory information. Don't forget to "Save".

  <div class="info-box">SOOMLA is all about free-to-play mobile games, we recommend you choose the “Free” option in the "Rights and Pricing" tab.</div>

- Make sure to use the correct Bundle ID. Read more about that [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html).

- Make sure you've followed all of [Apple's IAP prerequisites](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectInAppPurchase_Guide/Chapters/Introduction.html) before you can test your app.
