#**STORE: Amazon IAB**

##Follow these steps

 1. Create your app in Amazon Appstore Developer Console. If you're not sure how to do this, please read [Amazon In-app Billing](https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/submitting-your-app/tech-docs/submitting-your-app) before continuing.

 2. Once you’ve created your app, fill out the mandatory fields under the "General Information" tab. Click “Save” when you’re done.

 3. Go to the "In-app Items" tab. Before you add any items you'll find an explanation of the different item types.

    - Click on "Add a Consumable" or "Add an Entitlement".

    <div class="warning-box">Please note that SOOMLA does not support Subscription products, so do not choose this option.</div>

    - Fill in the mandatory fields.

    - Insert a product ID for your product in the SKU field. If you followed the steps in the [Getting Started](/docs/platforms/unity3d/GettingStarted) tutorial, you created product IDs for the items you wanted to sell for money. Now you need to insert the EXACT product IDs here.

    - Fill out the rest of the mandatory information. Don't forget to "Save".

    <div class="info-box">SOOMLA is all about free-to-play mobile games, so we recommend you set your app's "Base list price" to 0.00 in the “Availability & Pricing” tab.</div>
