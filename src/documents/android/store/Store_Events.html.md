# Event Handling

## About

SOOMLA's android-store allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

## How it Works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you about different things that happen involving Store operations.

For example, when a user purchases an item using virtual currency, his/her currency balance changes, causing a `CurrencyBalanceChangedEvent` to be fired.

## Observing & Handling Events

For event handling, SOOMLA uses Square's great open-source project [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/). In order to be notified of profile related events, you can register for specific events and create your game-specific behavior to handle them.

**In order to register for & handle events:**

1. In the class that should receive the event, create your event handler function with the annotation '@Subscribe'.

  For example:

  ``` java
  @Subscribe
  public void onCurrencyBalanceChangedEvent(
        CurrencyBalanceChangedEvent currencyBalanceChangedEvent) {
    // ... your game specific implementation here ...
  }
  ```

2. You'll also have to register your **event handler class** in the event bus:

  ``` java
  BusProvider.getInstance().register(this);
  ```

  and unregister when needed:

  ``` java
  BusProvider.getInstance().unregister(this);
  ```

  <div class="info-box">If your class is an Activity, register in 'onResume' and unregister in 'onPause'.</div>

## Store Events

Below is a list of all the events in SOOMLA Store and an example of how to observe & handle them. See a full [event handler example](https://github.com/soomla/android-profile/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/ExampleEventHandler.java).

This event is triggered when the Soomla Store module is initialized and ready.

``` java

<div class="warning-box">NOTE: Make sure to initialize the event handler for `SoomlaStoreInitializedEvent` before initializing SoomlaStore.</div>

  //   balance - the currency's balance after the change
  //   amountAdded - the change in balance that caused the event to be triggered

  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
