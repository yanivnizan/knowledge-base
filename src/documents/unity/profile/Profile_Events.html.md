#Event Handling

##About

Profile allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

###Tips & Reminders

- As mentioned in [Getting Started](/unity/profile/Profile_GettingStarted), make sure you add the event prefabs (ProfileEvents and CoreEvents) to your earliest loading scene.

- It is recommended that you register all events before initializing Profile.


##How it Works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you about different things that happen involving Profile operations.

For example, when a user posts a status, an `OnSocialActionStartedEvent` is fired as a result.


##Observing & Handling Events

The `ProfileEvents` class is where all events go through. To handle various events, just add your game-specific behavior to the delegates in the `ProfileEvents` class.

**For example:** To "listen" for an `onLoginFinished` event:

``` cs
// Sign up for the event
ProfileEvents.OnLoginFinished += onLoginFinished;

// Handle this event with your game-specific behavior:
public static void onLoginFinished(UserProfile userProfileJson, string payload){
	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

##Profile Events

###OnSoomlaProfileInitialized

This event is triggered when Soomla Profile has been initialized.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnSoomlaProfileInitialized += onSoomlaProfileInitialized;

public void onSoomlaProfileInitialized() {
	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnUserRatingEvent

This event is triggered when the page for rating your app is opened.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnUserRatingEvent += onUserRatingEvent;

public void onUserRatingEvent() {
	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnUserProfileUpdated

This event is triggered when the user profile has been updated, after login.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnUserProfileUpdated += onUserProfileUpdated;

public void onUserProfileUpdated(UserProfile userProfileJson) {
	// userProfileJson is the user's profile from the logged in provider

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLoginStarted

This event is triggered when logging into the social provider has started.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLoginStarted += onLoginStarted;

public void onLoginStarted(Provider provider, string payload) {
	// provider is the social provider
	// payload is an identification string that you can give when you initiate the login operation and want to receive back upon starting

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLoginFinished

This event is triggered when logging into the social provider has finished **successfully**.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLoginFinished += onLoginFinished;

public void onLoginFinished(UserProfile userProfileJson, string payload) {
	// userProfileJson is the user's profile from the logged in provider
	// payload is an identification string that you can give when you initiate the login operation and want to receive back upon its completion

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLoginCancelled

This event is triggered when logging into the social provider has been cancelled.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLoginCancelled += onLoginCancelled;

public void onLoginCancelled(Provider provider, string payload) {
	// provider is the social provider
	// payload is an identification string that you can give when you initiate the login operation and want to receive back upon cancellation

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLoginFailed

This event is triggered when logging into the social provider has failed.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLoginFailed += onLoginFailed;

public void onLoginFailed(Provider provider, string message, string payload) {
	// provider is the social provider
	// message is the failure message
	// payload is an identification string that you can give when you initiate the login operation and want to receive back upon failure

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLogoutStarted

This event is triggered when logging out of the social provider has started.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLogoutStarted += onLogoutStarted;

public void onLogoutStarted(Provider provider) {
	// provider is the social provider

	// ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

###OnLogoutFinished

This event is triggered when logging out of the social provider has finished **successfully**.

``` cs
ProfileEvents.OnLogoutFinished += onLogoutFinished;

public void onLogoutFinished(Provider provider) {
	// provider is the social provider
