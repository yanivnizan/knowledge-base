##Unity Debug Messages

Unity debug messages will only be printed out if you build the project with Development Build checked.

##Android & iOS Debug Messages

If you want to see full debug messages from android-store and iOS-store you just need to check the box that says "Debug Messages" in the SOOMLA Settings.
