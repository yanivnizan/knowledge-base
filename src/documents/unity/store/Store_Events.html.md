# Event Handling

## About

SOOMLA allows you to subscribe to store events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur. SOOMLA's unity3d-store's event handling mechanism is based on the event-handling methods of android-store and ios-store. Throughout android-store and ios-store events are fired and in unity3d-store they are observed and handled.

### Tips & Reminders

- As mentioned in [Getting Started](/unity/store/Store_GettingStarted), make sure you add the event prefabs (StoreEvents and CoreEvents) to your earliest loading scene.

- It is recommended that you register all events before initializing Store.

## How it works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you on different things that happened involving Store operations.

For example, when a user buys a currency pack, his currency balance is updated. As a result, a `CurrencyBalanceChangedEvent` is fired.

## Observing & Handling Events

The `StoreEvents` class is where all events go through. To handle various events, just add your game-specific behavior to the delegates in the `StoreEvents` class.

For example, if you want to listen for a `MarketPurchaseStarted` event:

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnMarketPurchaseStarted += onMarketPurchaseStarted;

public void onMarketPurchaseStarted(PurchasableVirtualItem pvi) {
    // your game specific implementation here
}
```

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

## Store Events

Following is a list of all the events in SOOMLA Store and an example of how to observe & handle them.

### OnSoomlaStoreInitialized

This event is triggered when the Soomla Store module is initialized and ready.

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnSoomlaStoreInitialized += onSoomlaStoreInitialized;

public void onSoomlaStoreInitialized() {
    // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

**NOTE:** If you want to observe the `OnSoomlaStoreInitialized` event you have to set up the listener before you initialize `SoomlaStore`. So, put the following code:

```
StoreEvents.OnSoomlaStoreInitialized += onSoomlaStoreInitialized;
```

before

```
Soomla.SoomlaStore.Initialize(new Soomla.Example.YourIStoreAssets());
```

### OnCurrencyBalanceChanged

This event is triggered when the balance of a specific currency has changed.

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnCurrencyBalanceChanged += onCurrencyBalanceChanged;

public void onCurrencyBalanceChanged(VirtualCurrency virtualCurrency, int balance,
                                                                      int amountAdded) {
    // virtualCurrency - the currency whose balance was changed
    // balance - the balance of the currency after the change
    // amountAdded - the amount that was added to the currency balance
    //    (in case the number of currencies was removed this will be a negative value)

    // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnGoodBalanceChanged

This event is triggered when the balance of a specific virtual good has changed.

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnGoodBalanceChanged += onGoodBalanceChanged;

public void onGoodBalanceChanged(VirtualGood good, int balance, int amountAdded) {
    // virtualCurrency - the virtual good whose balance was changed
    // balance - the balance of the currency after the change
    // amountAdded - the amount that was added to the currency balance
    //    (in case the number of currencies was removed this will be a negative value)

    // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnMarketPurchaseStarted

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnMarketPurchaseStarted += onMarketPurchaseStarted;

public void onMarketPurchaseStarted(PurchasableVirtualItem pvi) {

    // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### OnMarketPurchase

``` cs
StoreEvents.OnMarketPurchase += onMarketPurchase;

    // pvi - the PurchasableVirtualItem that was just purchased
    // payload - a text that you can give when you initiate the purchase operation and
    //    you want to receive back upon completion
    // extra - contains platform specific information about the market purchase
    //    Android: The "extra" dictionary will contain "orderId" and "purchaseToken"
    //    iOS: The "extra" dictionary will contain "receipt" and "token"
